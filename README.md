Parti
=====


Parti is a tiny and simple "dots-and-sticks" physics library for JavaScript.

You could also describe it as a physics simulator which uses [Verlet integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) to iteratively and non-conservatively solve spatial constraints on a set of particles, if you're into that sort of thing.

See the [reference documentation](http://mandykoh.github.io/parti/reference/) for live examples.

To get Parti, run:

    git clone https://github.com/mandykoh/parti.git parti
    cd parti
    make

The library will be found in the `dist` directory.

Parti is released under an MIT License. See [LICENSE.txt](//github.com/mandykoh/parti/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the licensing terms.
